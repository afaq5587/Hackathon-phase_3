# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot with Beautiful Frontend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Overall Status**: READY FOR PLANNING

## Notes

- Specification covers 7 user stories across P1, P2, P3 priorities
- 26 functional requirements defined with clear MUST statements
- 10 measurable success criteria established
- 6 edge cases identified with expected system behavior
- Assumptions section documents Phase 2 dependencies
- No implementation technologies mentioned (frameworks, languages, APIs)
- All requirements are testable through acceptance scenarios

## Next Steps

- Run `/sp.clarify` if additional detail is needed
- Run `/sp.plan` to create the implementation plan
